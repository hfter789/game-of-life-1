New Design of conway Game of Life.
	The new design would keep the calculation function fft2, but there will be three parts of the program: viewer, data, and controller. Viewer gives what the users see, data has the matrix and does data calculation, and lastly, controller handles button clicks.

	I might switch platform to Django.??
